# spacetrouble
A Go-based REST API for booking space travel tickets. It allows users to create, view, and delete bookings for space trips while ensuring launchpad availability and avoiding conflicts with SpaceX launches. The project uses PostgreSQL for data storage and follows input validation rules for booking requests.
